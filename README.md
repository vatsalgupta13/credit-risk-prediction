Credit Risk Prediction using multiple algorithms - Data Mining &amp; Web Algorithms Project

Kindly first download all the required python packages before running the code. 
Keep the folder structure same.
Dataset used is a freely available credit risk dataset.
Since multiple algorithms have been used in a single code, it would be better to run the code in sections rather than all at once.
