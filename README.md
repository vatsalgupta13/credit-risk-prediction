Credit Risk Prediction using multiple algorithms - Data Mining &amp; Web Algorithms Project

1) First download all the required python packages before running the code. 
2) Keep the folder structure same.
3) Dataset used is a freely available credit risk dataset.
4) Since multiple algorithms have been used in a single code, it would be better to run the code in sections rather than all at once.
